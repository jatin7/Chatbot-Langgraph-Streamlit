# 🤖 Streamlit LangGraph Chatbot

This project is a web-based chatbot application built with Streamlit and [suspicious link removed]. It uses Google's Gemini model via langchain-google-genai to power the conversation and features a built-in memory system that automatically summarizes the conversation to manage context length.

## Features

**Interactive Chat UI:** A clean, responsive chat interface provided by Streamlit.

**Persistent Memory:** Uses LangGraph's MemorySaver to maintain conversation history for each user session (identified by a unique thread_id).

**Stateful Conversation Flow:** Built with LangGraph's StateGraph to manage the conversation state.

**Auto-Summarization:** After 6 messages, the graph automatically triggers a summarization step to condense the history, sending the summary back to the model as context for future turns.

**Google Gemini Model:** Leverages the gemini-2.5-flash model for fast and capable chat responses.
