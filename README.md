# Chatbot---Langgraph-Streamlit
This repository contains a full-stack chatbot application. The backend is built with LangGraph, using Google's Gemini model for responses and a custom node that automatically summarizes the conversation after 6 messages. The frontend is a user-friendly Streamlit interface. All chat history is made persistent using an SQLite database.
